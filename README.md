# Proman4713 Development Team!
Hello everyone! We're from the Proman4713 Development Team (the name's long, I know), and we're the team behind some good games, such as our current project, HALIENS.

## What is 'HALIENS'?
Well, it's a open-ended story, set in the year 3000, in which humanity traveled to space and lived there until the year 4000. But then, a catastrophic space crash occurred, leaving only one survivor - the player. The player's mind was connected to the spacesuit that they had on, so when the suit lost power, it caused them to shut down.

Aliens stumbled upon the player and, mistaking them for a non-intelligent creature, take them in for experimentation. The aliens transformed their body into a robot-like form and trapped him in a seemingly inescapable system filled with infinite levels.

Even though they could move now, the player must try to find fuel for their suit before trying to restore their body.

Desperate for escape, the player must navigate through the various levels, finding bugs and exploits in the system to break free. But as time goes on, however, hope dwindles. 
Eventually, the player finally escapes, but the story remains open-ended, leaving room for a sequel!
